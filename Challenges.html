    <p>Suppose there are two trains going towards Delhi. First is Train A which is originating from Agra at 06:00 AM and second is Train B which is originating from Aligarh at 06:20 AM, and they both will arrive at Mathura on 07:30 AM and 07:35AM respectively. 
        Train A has 5 boggies/compartments and each compartment has one attendant namely Att 1, Att2, Att3, Att4, Att5, and Train B has also 5 boggies/compartments and each compartment has one attendant namely Att6, Att7, Att8, Att9, Att10.        
        When train B reaches Mathura loco pilot of Train B detected that engine is not in good condition and will face breakdown in between of Mathura and Delhi. He intimates everything to the Station Manager immediately, and Station Manager and DRM decided that they will merge all the boggies/compartments after Train A.        
        Write an Algorithm or Java Program to merge both structures one after one.</p>

        Suppose there are two trains Train C and Train D, originating from Lucknow Junction at interval of 5mins and departing towards Shri Mata Vaishno Devi Katra. Initially Train C has five compartments and each compartment has an attendant namely Q, W, E, R, T and Train D has also five compartments and each compartment has an attendant namely Y, U, I, O, P. Due to some technical issues a compartment is shifting from a luxury Train C to semi-luxury train D, which has an attendant E. and one compartment is shifting from a semi-luxury Train D to luxury train C, which has an attendant I.
        
        Write an Algorithm or Java Program for the same.

    <P>
        There are two train TrainE and TrainF. Each train has 5 compartments. Each compartment has passengers from following states: Uttar Pradesh, Himachal Pradesh, Gujarat, Maharashtra, Kerala. There is one restriction that for each state citizens there is one dedicated compartment only, irrespective of sequence of compartment, like if Maharashtra state citizens are sitting in compartment 2nd, all of them will sit only there. Bookings will not allow in any other compartment for them, and there is no guarantee that if TrainE reserves booking of Maharashtra citizen in compartment 2nd, TrainF will do same, may be TrainF reserves booking of Maharashtra citizen in compartment 1st or in 2nd or in 3rd, and so on. Indian railways want to know that how many citizens of each states, state-wise, are travelling in both trains. 
        Write a java program to implement this structure and perform this operation.

        There is a train, TrainZ; there are four compartments arranged in the following sequence:

<p> comp3 after comp2,</p>
<p>  comp2 after comp1, and </p>
<p> comp1 after engine.</p>
<p> After arrangement as per the above sequence, administration found that there is one compartment (suppose comp2) is wrongly linked with TrainZ. So write a java program to detach or delink the comp2 and display following statements: </p>
<p> Compartment 3 has linked after Compartment 1 in TrainM</p>
<p> Compartment 4 has linked after Compartment 3 in TrainM</p>
<p>
